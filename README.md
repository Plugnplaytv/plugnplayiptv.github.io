# PlugNPlay IPTV Website

This repository contains the source for the PlugNPlay IPTV landing page hosted via GitHub Pages.
It includes basic marketing content and links for purchasing service plans. The site is built as
a collection of static HTML files and does not require any build step.

The main page now uses the Inter web font and modern styling with placeholder images to give it a cleaner look.
